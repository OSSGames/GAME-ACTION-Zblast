This is a Linux port of a game I wrote for MS-DOS (yuck) late last
year. The Linux version is much better, mainly because it has sound.
Bear in mind that you must have Voxware v3 (i.e. a recent kernel) to
have sound - if there's a file /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/Readme.v30
on your system, you've got it.

You need svgalib and the rawkey library v0.2 to compile zblast. (A
pre-compiled copy of the rawkey library is included.) Zblast only
supports sound on real soundcards - sorry, but /dev/pcsp won't work.

If anyone wants to try adding new levels (there isn't many at the
moment), have a look at levels.c and mail me if you get some together.

Other than that, 'make install' is the next step, then read the man
page, then run zblast and hammer that space bar!


Have fun,
